# long day honey?

"yes dear, it was wall to wall meetings all day"

then you havent done a thing

in the fraud economy, people expect to be paid to sit and talk

company executives expect to be paid to sit and talk about their business requirements

government officials expect to be paid to sit and talk about their policy requirements

meanwhile, everyone else works to measurably produce and regulate the distribution of goods and services

impressionable youth observing this comfy behavior aspire to become "international business/politics" students who will travel the world, sit in meetings, and tell everyone else what to do after they graduate

then theyre left with no hard skills to sustain them

#### the global economy is plagued by a flourishing con artist culture in the white collar workforce

and applying old fashion blue collar labor management science through modern technology—to the white collar side—will tear away the veil concealing the identity of those who fail to productively exercise authority from committees, boards, corporations, democracies and any other organization where individual productivity is conveniently blurred

#### whether mental, verbal or written, all production begins with requirements

and forcing them all to be written will prove those who produce valuable information from those who socially hack their way into consuming its rewards

"requirements" is a more common word in software

and the software industry is notorious for allowing people to build careers by repeating in meetings the requirements they overhear in other meetings

entire organizations are then forced to submit to the opinions of those who [mitm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) their way into executive level jobs without authoring requirements

another software industry failure is the applying of unequal productivity standards between employee types

for example, software engineering productivity is measured by counting lines of code and the expense to operate them

but counting lines of requirements and matching them to revenue is conveniently ignored by product owners and executives

meeting and [slack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slack_(software)) addicted software executives who avoid the means to prove the value of their personal contribution keep their jobs for years as they substitute authorship data and the empirical performance of their requirements with social hackery

#### authorship is measurable

version control vastly increases the convenience of measuring the production and value of information

instead of proposing them in meetings and chat applications, drafting requirements in version control protects their authorship

submitting drafts for others to amend through version control protects contributors and stakeholders

#### "writing is too much work"

reproducing the consistency and accessibility of written information through verbal communication is more work

also, communications efficiency is increased by practicing how to write less, not talk more

style has nothing to do with knowledge

avoid the overhead of formality and style while expressing simply written ideas

style violations are easily forgiven when succinct statements show consideration for everyones time

#### measure hourly labor

paying people annual salaries while they follow their own agenda is poor labor science

the technology to measure hourly labor is now conveniently available

put yourself on the clock first, then everyone else

the minor inconvenience of hitting a start and end button, and writing a brief description of the current task to inform the buyer of labor *how time is invested* does not outweigh their responsibility to measure its return

#### enforce accountability through requirement definition standards

instead of entitling someone the right to issue a meeting invite upon inspiration of a requirement, force them to start a draft

testing someones will to personally write a requirement before circulating it among meeting attendants is enough to learn whether the author believes its actionable

and the probability of work following a written requirement is higher than the one verbally expressed, then forgotten during a meeting

#### compensate labor performed for written requirements

1. writing
1. reading
1. writing questions
1. writing answers
1. writing amendments

#### do NOT compensate people for negotiating and producing requirements verbally

people are welcome to meet and communicate verbally on personally funded time

excepting courtesy and interactions lasting three minutes, click yourself off the clock, then talk

funding verbal information with personal time protects labor investors from high risk information, and behavior attempting to pass off socializing for working

#### compensate training

trainings are often reduced to "meetings" by executives and government officials seeking to conceal the cost of their ignorance

"explain how this works to me so i can avoid reading the manual" is not evil so long as its expense is recorded

the valuable educator will be measured

the valuable learner will be measured

and measuring the leader who produces growth while spending half the day learning sets a healthy example

but shareholders and citizens will seek to maximize their investment by discovering growths educator

#### set an example immediately

if youve reached the apex of labor where you do nothing but push a pen or tap keys to produce requirements, then out of consideration to the blue collar workforce who must measurably deliver them, set your productivity as also measurable and hold colleagues to the same standard

whether its a coworker inviting you to "discuss a new product", an investment partner inviting you to "discuss a new venture", or a senator inviting you to "discuss a new policy"

kindly advise them youll first accept, read and contribute to a version controlled draft while on the clock to protect the economy from confusing whos authoring value, and whos only consuming it

#### summary

use version control and time tracking daily to protect authorships value
